It might look inactive, but I assure you, I use it.</p>

<div>
<p>- <em>Can you come back?</em><br />No, if I left, I probably left for a good reason.<br /><br />- <em>Why'd you setup this html file as if anyone actually cares?</em><br />Boredom and freedom to do whatever I want as long as it doesn't harm others, get off my back.</p>
